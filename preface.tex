\begin{comment} I owe it all to my supervisor Professor Reinhard Furrer for his guidance throughout this project.
His insights and intuition for numerical methods have been most memorable lessons for me.
I would also like to thank Professor Barbara KÃ¶nig for not only giving interesting research
questions, but also for giving me such a rich lesson about animal behavior. My thanks also goes
to Dr. Julian Evans for his help with the data set and advice.
This thesis is but a culmination of my master program, and for that, I would also like to thank Dr.
Eva Furrer for all her care in ensuring that we have received the best education and experience. I
would also like to thank Professor Leonhard Held and Dr. Ulrike Held, who taught me practical
biostatistics.
Last but not least, thank you to my family for always believing in me.
